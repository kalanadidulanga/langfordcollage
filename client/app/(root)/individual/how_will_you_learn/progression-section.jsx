                                The  langford college programmes are mapped against UK higher education qualifications which are fully transferable to a range of other higher education routes and professional qualifications. On completion of the  langford college level 4/5 programme students will be awarded 240 credits (The first 2 years of a undergraduate degree) . They can then top up to their final year at one of our university partners who recognise the qualification. Similarly at level 7 students gain 120 credits from a total of 180 credits for an MBA. Again they can top up at an  langford college university partner.
